# UStudy
UStudy is a website aimed at making forming study groups more accessible and centralized. 

The website includes the following pages:
- **index.html**: A login page, which allows users that have not created an account to create an account, and allows old users to sign in.
- **home.html**: A home page, displaying a calendar of the student's events
- **event.html**: A page to create events, either public or private.
- **find-students.html**: A page to find other students in your class, displaying their profiles. Users can message other students on this page as well.
